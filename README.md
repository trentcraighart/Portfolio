# Trent Craig Hart's Portfolio

In this repository I hope to highlight some of the more interesting elements of my Security and Software Development work

### CS-419 System Security

CS-419 was an opportunity to dig into the academic world of security through dissecting research papers and implementing their findings to exploit a system built by our professor. The following were the projects we implemented in the class:
* Rowhammer
* Cache Side Channel Attacks
* Spectre
* Meltdown
* Library/System Call Hooks
* Intel SGX Flush Reload Attacks
* SGX Oblivious Memory Access
* Clickjacking
* Usage of Intel's PIN
* Fuzzing
* Symbolic Execution
Here is a link to the class: https://syssec.unexploitable.systems/index.html

### CS-478 Advanced Network Security

CS-478 was my first exposure to computer security and the birthplace of my love for the subject matter. While I should've started with an intro class first, it was hectic and fun to dive into the deep end of the subject matter. In this class a partner and I had 3 projects we had to implement in which I took charge of 2 and 3. The following are brief descriptions of what I implemented.

##### Lab 2 - Implementation of HORS Signature Scheme
I implemented the one time public key signature scheme by Reyzin and Reyzin that is explained in their academic paper here https://www.cs.bu.edu/~reyzin/papers/one-time-sigs.pdf

##### Lab 3 - Implementation of Rabin's Information Dispersal
In this project I developed the basic outline for Rabin's Information Dispersal. The concept is to transform a file into x pieces in which you only need y to rebuild the original document. Here is an explanation of the process and underlying mathematics: https://metacpan.org/pod/Crypt::IDA

### CS-311 Operating Systems 1

Within Operating Systems 1, I was given the opportunity to build my own shell in C that had the use of signals, threads, and mutexes. While it's not an incredibly robust project, it still stands as one of my proudest accomplishments due to the learning and growth it inspired.

### Capstone Project - Hospital Recommendation Engine

The hospital recommendation engine was the first time I was able to conduct large amounts of personal research on TensorFlow and machine learning. In our development of the AI, we struggled to find access to any medical records that we could build a prediction model with, so it transitioned away from AI to building models through documented hospital norms. In addition to my research into TensorFlow, this project allowed me to develop my research capabilities to be multi-disciplined, diving deep into the world of medical triaging and hospital management.

In addition to the research and development, we strived to build sound documentation that outlined the engineering concepts, processes, and results of our work. In this documentation we saw a need to deliver our work in IEEE standard formats, and thus wrote our documentation with Latex to meet industry standards.
